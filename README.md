# Clustering
This project is based on the K-Means clustering algorithm.
* In this project, we scrape the data about neighborhoods in Canada from a Wikipedia page.
* This can be done with the BeautifulSoup (BS4) package.
* We use the read_html function of Pandas to read the data.
* The read_html finds each table in the web page and reads them into a separate dataframe.
